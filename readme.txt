
Here is a detailed README file for your C program that manages a task list with options to add, show, delete, and edit tasks, and saves the tasks to a binary file. The README explains the functionality, usage, and structure of the program.

Task List Manager
Overview
This C program allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add tasks, display the list of tasks, delete tasks, and edit tasks. All tasks are stored in a file named tasks.bin for persistence.

Features
Add Task: Allows the user to add a new task to the list.
Show Tasks: Displays all the current tasks in the list.
Delete Task: Removes a specified task from the list.
Edit Task: Edits the description of a specified task.
Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved to a binary file named tasks.bin for future access.
How to Use
Compile the Program:
Use a C compiler like gcc to compile the program.

bash
Copy code
gcc -o task_manager task_manager.c
Run the Program:
Execute the compiled program.

bash
Copy code
./task_manager
Choose an Option:

1 => Add task: Add a new task to the list.
2 => Show tasks: Display all tasks currently in the list.
3 => Delete task: Delete a specific task from the list by its number.
4 => Edit task: Edit the description of a specific task.
5 => Quit: Exit the program.
Follow the Prompts:
Enter the task descriptions and numbers as prompted by the program.

Program Structure
Global Variables:

char taskList[100][100]: A 2D array to store up to 100 tasks with a maximum length of 100 characters each.
int taskCount: Keeps track of the number of tasks in the list.
int i: A counter used to maintain the task numbers.
Functions:

void Initialize(): Initializes the task list by reading from the tasks.bin file.
void AddTask(): Adds a new task to the task list and appends it to the tasks.bin file.
void ShowTasks(): Reads and displays the contents of the tasks.bin file.
void DeleteTask(): Deletes a task from the list and updates the tasks.bin file.
void EditTask(): Edits the description of an existing task in the list and updates the tasks.bin file.
Main Function:

The main function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the task list.
Detailed Function Descriptions
void Initialize()
Purpose: Reads the last task number from the tasks.bin file to ensure that task numbers are incremented correctly.
Process:
Opens tasks.bin for reading.
Reads through the file and updates the global counter i with the last task number.
Closes the file.
void AddTask()
Purpose: Allows the user to add a new task to the task list.
Process:
Prompts the user for a new task description.
Increments the task count and global counter i.
Appends the new task to the tasks.bin file with a task number.
void ShowTasks()
Purpose: Displays all the tasks currently stored in the tasks.bin file.
Process:
Opens tasks.bin for reading.
Reads and prints each line (task) from the file.
Closes the file.
void DeleteTask()
Purpose: Allows the user to delete a specific task from the list.
Process:
Checks if the tasks.bin file is empty.
Prompts the user for the task number to delete.
Removes the specified task from the array and shifts the remaining tasks.
Rewrites the updated list back to the tasks.bin file.
void EditTask()
Purpose: Allows the user to edit the description of a specific task.
Process:
Checks if the tasks.bin file is empty.
Prompts the user for the task number to edit.
Prompts the user for a new description.
Updates the task in the array and rewrites the updated list back to the tasks.bin file.
